# TrafficLightClassification

This repository contains the source code for a traffic classification program that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in order to classify random images of traffic lights.

# How to Run:

1. Ensure that the "train" folder that contains all the images of traffic light images is downloaded in the same folder as "trafficLightTrainer.py" and "evaluate_model.py".
2. Run the "trafficLightTrainer.py" to begin training the model using an IDE of your choice.
3. After completing a certain number of training epochs, check to see if "traffic_light_model.h5" has been saved.
4. After "traffic_light_model.h5" has been saved, run the "evaluate_model.py" using IDE of your choice.
